**Services**

Dai Foundation is a Danish independent and non-profit foundation which was established in order to safeguard certain intangible assets that underlie the open-source and decentralized MakerDAO software system, such as copyrights, trademarks, or domain names (the &quot; **MakerDAO**** Intangible Assets**&quot;), and to ensure that the MakerDAO Intangible Assets are used solely in line with the principles laid down in the Dai Foundation&#39;s foundational statutes. As a Danish foundation, the Dai Foundation is under mandatory supervision by the competent Danish authorities.

The Dai Foundation is fully independent, bound only by its foundational assets and applicable Danish law, and is not related to any other entities, persons, or projects operating within the broader open MakerDAO and blockchain ecosystem.
